# Gradient Descent – CS5002 Project

This repository contains my implementation of Project 1 (Parts 1 & 2) for the course **CS5002: Discrete Structures** at Northeastern University (Spring 2025).

The project explores how to implement and apply **gradient descent** to optimize mathematical functions and fit simple predictive models to real-world-like data.
